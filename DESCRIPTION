Description: The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart
  Association blood pressure guideline recommends using 10-year predicted 
  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk to guide the decision to 
  initiate or intensify antihypertensive medication. The guideline recommends 
  using the Pooled Cohort risk prediction equations to predict 10-year 
  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This package implements the 
  original Pooled Cohort risk prediction equations and also incorporates 
  updated versions based on more contemporary data and statistical methods.
